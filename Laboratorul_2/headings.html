    <p>We have already discussed headers and the purpose of their usage in a HTML document. They are tags of low
        complexity and provide the user a systemic way of organizing headers and the titles they are usually employed to
        represent.</p>

    <p>Header types are hierarchically organized by their font size. As such, progressively larger header identifiers
        will produce a header of increasingly smaller size. Their font size and style is predefined by the html
        specification and, in certain cases, by that of the browser rendering them. Generally, browsers respect the
        conventional font size and style.</p>

    <p>We may want a customized header size and font style, in which case, we will need to use certain specifiers to
        modify the characteristic we so desire. If we desire to alter the header's font size, we will use the style
        specifier with the "font-size": xpx" option. Supplementary, if we desire to modify the font style, we will use
        the "font-family: font" option.</p>
