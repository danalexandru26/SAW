        <p>In this document we will discuss some of the most important HTML tags and properties. Tables serve us with
            an ubiquitous way of organizing and displaying data of almost any kind. There are scarcely any limits to
            what a table can functionally display and do. The limitation sits enirely with how we organize, store and
            display our data.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we will also dive into the intricacies of HTML classes that we may associate to tags,
            identifiers and some finer details on <code>div</code> block elements. Such chapters will also serve as an
            introduction to more advanced web development and design concepts such as the use of javascript and CSS.
