    <p>We have already discussed headers and the purpose of their usage in a HTML document. They are tags of low
        complexity and provide the user a systemic way of organizing headers and the titles they are usually employed to
        represent.</p>

    <p>Header types are hierarchically organized by their font size. As such, progressively larger header identifiers
        will produce a header of increasingly smaller size. Their font size and style is predefined by the html
        specification and, in certain cases, by that of the browser rendering them. Generally, browsers respect the
        conventional font size and style.</p>

    <p>We may want a customized header size and font style, in which case, we will need to use certain specifiers to
        modify the characteristic we so desire. If we desire to alter the header's font size, we will use the style
        specifier with the "font-size": xpx" option. Supplementary, if we desire to modify the font style, we will use
        the "font-family: font" option.</p>

    <p>You may also have noticed that the headings on this page appear centered. This can be done by using the
        "text-align:center;" style option. There are many more options we may use to customize our textual information
        and we'll get to them in a latter page, solely dedicated to stylistic options. As far as it concerns this mage,
        we'll have some fun with headers.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:30px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align:center;">This is a customized
        level 1 header</h1>
    <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana; text-align:center;">This is a customized level 2 header</h2>
    <h3 style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;">This is a customized level 3 header</h3>
