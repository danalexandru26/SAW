<h1> Forms and Interactables</h1>
<hr>

<body><br>
    <div class="center_div">
        <h2>Prelude</h2>
        <p>This document will teach us on what forms and interactables are and how we may use them to enhance the user
            experience. Furthermore, it will be presented why and how forms represent the principal method of web-page
            user data acquisition. It is through forms that a user may interact with the data acquisition and processing
            mechanisms that sit behind the front of our web-page. It is forms precisely that we encounte whenever a
            web-site prompts us to commit our data for various purposes such as payment procedures, registration and so
            much more.</p>

        <p>It is also wise to view forms as compound structures that achieve their role through the use of various
            interactable objects. These interactable objects are HTML items a user will interact with, such as buttons,
            drop-down lists and text boxes. In order to study and then use forms we first have to some of the most
            important objects we can make use of. This is precisely what the following chapters will try to achieve.</p>

        <h2> Buttons and text boxes</h2>
        <p>Buttons are relatively simple structures with some interesting fiels we'll go over. A button can be declared
            by using the <code>button</code> tag.</p>
        <pre>

&lt;<span style="color:maroon">button</span>&gt; Press Me
        </pre>
        <p>The result of this tag can be seen below, it's quite simple.</p>
        <button class="exampleButton"> Press Me</button>
        <p>There are many CSS style options specific to buttons that we may use in improving their style, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>button.buttonClass:hover</code> defines what shall occur when our cursor hovers over the button.
            </li>
            <li><code>transition-duration</code> defines how long it takes for our button to change color as specified
                in the hover property.</li>
            <li><code>cursor</code> defines how our cursor will look when the mouse hovers over the button's box. There
                are many options, such as <code>auto, pointer, default, move, not-allowed</code> and several others.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="button_div">
            <button class="buttonStyleA">Style A</button>
            <button class="buttonStyleB">Style B</button>
        </div>

        <p>We can see the effects and their length of duration by hovering over the buttons above. In the context of
            forms, there is another attribute of buttons that we may use. That is, the button <code>type</code> option.
            It has two possible values, <code>submit</code> and <code>reset</code>. Reset may be used to clear the set
            context of the form's data fields while submit is generally used to submit the personalized data to a
            back-end processing pipeline, however simple.</p>

        <h2>Forms and Inputs</h2>
        <p>As has been elaborated before, forms are no more than entities defined by the sum of their interactable
            components.
            These components bear the name of inputs and they can be of many types, as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> are the basic elements for raw text submissions, regardless of
                any
                format unless so enformed by the back-end or through web-page scripts.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;label&gt;</code> is an element with a fixed descriptive function, used for the
                annotation of other interactables.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code> is a multiple option and (generally) single choice submission
                data acquisition input.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> is generally used to answer questions that have well defined
                and fixed options.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> is a button used for form submission.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;input type="button"&gt;</code> is a general button that can serve many functions, often times
                it can even be used to generate in-page pop-up secondary forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <form style="text-align: center;">
            <label for="name">Name</label><br>
            <input type="text" name="name" id="nameBox"><br>

            <label for="iCountry">Country</label><br>
            <input type="text" name="iCountry" id="countryBox"><br><br>

            <input type="submit" name="submitButton" id="sButton1"><br><br>
            <input type="reset" name="resetButton" id="rButton1"><br>
        </form>

        <p>Out of these two button interactables only the function of the reset button can be observed. The submit
            button has no real back-end toward which to publish the data and as such nothing of relevance will happen.
            It's also worth noting that this form is extremely minimalistic and by no means is it a representative
            example for all that can be achieved. However, it does serve as a useful proof of concept. After all, forms
            are nothing more but slightly sophisticated tools of user data acqusition. For more information on forms
