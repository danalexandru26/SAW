    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> 1. HTML Attributes</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 1.1 Hyperlinks and their attributes</h2>
    <p>Hyperlinks are inserted into our document by using the a tag paired up with the href specifier. However, there
        are a few attributes that can be added to the a tag to modify its behavior and appearance.
    </p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art">For example, this hyperlink will redirect us to the
        wikipedia page on the Baroque art current.</a>
    <p>If so desired, we can also nest this hyperlink within a paragraph in order to only highlight the desired text to
        redirect. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art"> The Renaissance</a> is a splendid art
        current.
        We can also specify in what frame the new webpage, specified by the hyperlink, is to be opened. For example,
        let's say we desire to open the webpage in a new tab. In order to achieve this we will use the target ="_blank"
        attribute specifier.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art" target="_blank">Renaissance</a>, in a new tab.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 1.2 Images and affiliated attributes</h2>
    <p>It is often useful to insert images, among other things, into our document. In order to accomplish this we will
        use the img tag and its source specifier src. To successfully display an image, it needs to be present on our
        machine, exactly at the location our src specifier's value redirects to. Because one of software's engineering
        goal is minimizing confusion during the development process, it's advisable to always use a referential image
        source, not an absolute path. The reason for this is simple, an absolute path need not exist on another user's
        machine and as such, in the least problematic of cases, the image will not be displayed. In the more severe
        scenarios, when working with documents of increasing complexity, our whole webpage may error and fail to load
        because someone decided, against better judgement, to use an absolute path specifier.
    </p>
    <img src="images/vanAelst.jpg" alt="Bocquet image has failed to load" class="center">
    <p>Notice that our image has been centered. This is not the default behavior, the generic html style aligns all data
        to the left margin. In order to center our image, a css syle specifier was used. How this is done will be
        covered in another document. So, for now, it will remain a grand mistery.</p>
    <p>What's interesting is that we may also attach a hyperlink to our image. It can be achieved by nesting an image
        tag within a hyperlink specifier.</p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" target="_blank"><img src="images/boticelli.jpg"
            title="Boticelli" class="center"></a>
    <p>If you're astute, you may also have noticed that this inserted image displays a tooltip when hovered by a mouse.
        This can be done by adding the title specifier to our tag of interest. In our case, we added the specifier to
        our image tag.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">A closing note</h1>
        <p>There are many more attributes, values and styles one may use. We have covered only the basics of their usage
            and
            definition. For an exhaustive trove of information on attributes, it is suggested to access the following
            webpage: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html" target="_blank">W3Schools's guide to HTML
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, we may also use the mozilla's foundation extension documentation on HTML <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" alt="MDN cannot be loaded" target="_blank">MDN

                documentation </a></p>
